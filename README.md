* Direct message (one to one message)
* Offline messages' history
* Received receipts (you can see if a message was sent and delivered)
* Presence Manager with online/offline and inactivity period indicator
* Show integration of a custom user profile's view
* Signup/Login with email and password
* Synchronized contacts (with offline search and selection)
* Integrates an example of a mobile live-chat support (an "help" button on the top left corner of every tab)
