# README #

First of all you MUST create a new Firebase project, then install the Firebase backend cloud functions available [here](https://github.com/chat21/chat21-cloud-functions). 

Then run "pod install" in the project folder.

Start the project with the new created file "tilechat.xcworkspace".

More detailed instructions will be available soon.

Meanwhile feel free to contact us at support@frontiere21.it.

Enjoy.
